## POP3

This module set allows users to access E-mail accounts using the POP3 protocol.
This protocol is inferior to the IMAP protocol, and Cypht does not support as
many features for E-mail management as compared to IMAP because of that.

POP3 support will be removed from Cypht: https://github.com/cypht-org/cypht/issues/452
